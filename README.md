# Bakery

For this project I wanted to venture out and make my first proper static website to familiarize myself with HTML,CSS and Bootstrap more. Choosing to create a restaurant website was a good starting point because it allowed me to envision something that a customer or client would want and find useful instead of something that only I would find usefull.

Not much javascript was used for this project but I had to use it to have some functionality work with no errors such as making the different menu buttons work and modify some elements that appeared across multiple pages.
